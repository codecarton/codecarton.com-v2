	<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
	<h3>Subscription period</h3>
	<p>
		The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid Subscription. You will
		be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly or
		annually), depending on the type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the
		Subscription.
	</p>

	<p>
		At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same
		conditions unless You cancel it or the Company cancels it.
	</p>

	<h3>Subscription cancellations</h3>
	<p>
		You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account settings page or by
		contacting the Company. You will not receive a refund for the fees You already paid for Your
		current Subscription period and You will be able to access the Service until the end of Your
		current Subscription period.
	</p>

	<p>
		If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, You can cancel the renewal of Your
		Subscription with the Application Store.
	</p>

	<h3>Billing</h3>
	<p>
		You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full
		name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.
	</p>

	<p>
		Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic
		invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full
		payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
	</p>

	<p>
		If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, all billing is handled by the
		Application Store and is governed by the Application Store's own terms and conditions.
	</p>

	<h3>Fee Changes</h3>
	<p>
		The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any
		Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription
		period.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to
		give You an opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
	</p>

	<p>
		Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect
		constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
	</p>

	<h3>Refunds</h3>
	<p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

	<p>
		Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the Company on a case-by-case
		basis and granted at the sole discretion of the Company.
	</p>

	<p>
		If the Subscription has been made through an In-app purchase, the Application Store's refund
		policy will apply. If You wish to request a refund, You may do so by contacting the Application
		Store directly.
	</p>

	<h3>Free Trial</h3>
	<p>
		The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a Free Trial for a limited
		period of time.
	</p>

	<p>
		You may be required to enter Your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.
	</p>

	<p>
		If You do enter Your billing information when signing up for a Free Trial, You will not be
		charged by the Company until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial
		period, unless You cancelled Your Subscription, You will be automatically charged the applicable
		Subscription fees for the type of Subscription You have selected.
	</p>

	<p>
		At any time and without notice, the Company reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and
		conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

	<h3>In-app Purchases</h3>
	<p>
		The Application may include In-app Purchases that allow you to buy products, services or
		Subscriptions.

		More information about how you may be able to manage In-app Purchases using your Device may be
		set out in the Application Store's own terms and conditions or in your Device's Help settings.
	</p>

	<p>
		In-app Purchases can only be consumed within the Application. If you make a In-app Purchase,
		that In-app Purchase cannot be cancelled after you have initiated its download. In-app Purchases
		cannot be redeemed for cash or other consideration or otherwise transferred.
	</p>

	<p>
		If any In-app Purchase is not successfully downloaded or does not work once it has been
		successfully downloaded, we will, after becoming aware of the fault or being notified to the
		fault by You, investigate the reason for the fault. We will act reasonably in deciding whether
		to provide You with a replacement In-app Purchase or issue You with a patch to repair the fault.
		In no event will We charge You to replace or repair the In-app Purchase. In the unlikely event
		that we are unable to replace or repair the relevant In-app Purchase or are unable to do so
		within a reasonable period of time and without significant inconvenience to You, We will
		authorize the Application Store to refund You an amount up to the cost of the relevant In-app
		Purchase. Alternatively, if You wish to request a refund, You may do so by contacting the
		Application Store directly.
	</p>

	<p>
		You acknowledge and agree that all billing and transaction processes are handled by the
		Application Store from where you downloaded the Application and are governed by that Application
		Store's own terms and conditions.

		If you have any payment related issues with In-app Purchases, then you need to contact the
		Application Store directly.

	<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
	<p>
		Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of
		its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the
		foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if
		You haven't purchased anything through the Service.
	</p>

	<p>
		To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its
		suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever
		(including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information,
		for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way
		related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party
		hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms),
		even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even
		if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for
		incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not
		apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted
		by law.
	</p>

	<h3>”AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h3>
	<p>
		The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects

		kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible

		Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any

		that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are
		free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on
		applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and
		limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in
		this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
	</p>

	<h3>Governing Law</h3>
	<p>
