Woodworking is fun. Math isn't. Making the most of our precious time in the shop is critical. One16 can help. One16 was designed to respect your time, reduce errors, and make mundane math operations less painful.

## Introducing Actions.

Automate common calculations into fast actions. One of our favorites is calculating board feet. We ship One16 with a few to get you started. But creating your own is where the power of Actions shines.

To get a sense of how powerful Actions are watch our quick video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/OtvuM8Di7hE?si=ni77hkFB4O6lonlL).

## New Icons.

We have added 5 new icons for you to select from. We hope you find one that fits your style.

## Simplify Faster.

Now you can simplify fractions with a single tap of the equals button. This is a great way to reduce errors and save time.

## Improved Widgets.

Designed with glanceability at its core. They give you quick references to your critical measurements without unlocking your phone or opening the app. These have been improved in version two to support light mode and larger numbers.

## Privacy First.

Privacy is at the core of all our products. One16 doesn't track any data about you or your usage. If you do find a bug, please reach out to us! We will do our best to get it fixed promptly. We love chatting with our users!
