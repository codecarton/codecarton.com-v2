We released version 2.2.0 to the App Store. This update has been a long time coming. We updated our business model from paid up front to freemium.

The decision to switch wasn’t easy for us. I prefer this type of app as single purchase upfront from a developer and user perspective. Unfortunately, until Apple allows for app trials it’s difficult to let customers understand how your app will fit into their workflow before spending the money on it.

This lead to less than ideal sales and a difficult time getting a sufficient volume of reviews on the App Store.

Our In-App Purchase is a onetime purchase. This gives us the best of both worlds. Users can download the app for free, get a feel for the app and the features we offer. If they would like to gain access to the more powerful features, they can upgrade to One16 Pro.

## Current Customers

But what about users who paid for One16 from the App Store I hear you asking. This was the biggest problem for us to solve. We care deeply about honoring our promise to previous users. They are what have allowed us to keep developing the app.

We implemented a system to capture the users purchase receipt from Apple. If a customer purchased the app before 2.2.0 then they are eligible for all current and future Pro features without any additional purchase.

Unfortunately, there isn’t a way for us to automatically get this information and avoid them from ever seeing our new paywall. To address this we added a callout in the paywall for users to unlock the features.

## Conclusion

We are grateful for all our customers who took a chance on our app and purchased it before being able to try it out. We will always respect their trust in us and offer Pro features to them free of charge.

We look forward to getting One16 into the hands of new users that were deterred from an upfront payment.

With this change we are in a good place to begin work on many new features that we’d love to add. More on that soon!
